AutoReloader version 0.01
=========================

This package is a drop-in replacement for AutoLoader.
Other than the core AutoLoader package, this one provides lazy
loading of files that return a subroutine reference on require.

But it's main purpose is to provide reloading of subs.

Each subroutine, when loaded, is wrapped into an outer sub.
Inside that one, a check of the subroutine's source file is
done, and if the value returned from that sub is different to
the value at load time, the function is reloaded. If the
reload fails, only the memorized check value is updated, and
the function's previous version is retained. After checking,
a magic 'goto $funcref' is performed - the function is called.

This is most useful for development and for long running
applications that must be updated at runtime, or for those that
wish to extend, grow or shrink packages at runtime.

This package depends on Scalar::Util (XS version), since it
makes use of the weaken and reftype functions therein.

Tested under perl-5.6.2.
