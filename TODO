- all that's in the pod
- extend test suite
- check under autouse (autouse AutoReloader, autouse modules that use AutoReloader)
- make this module obsolete by patching AutoLoader :-)
- provide for more path changes and access methods of subroutines
  The 'auto' part of a subroutine should be changeable, as well as the full path
  to a subroutine source file. Then, a subroutine's access method should be made
  more flexible, e.g. reading code from some database, retrieve via LWP, or else.
  But maybe that should be left to subclasses.
